Analysis of Sales , Advertisement data of BigMart:-
Mr Roy has joined BigMart few months ago, as a Sr. Sales Manager. BigMart is doing good in the market and with the stable performance over the years, management is now looking big numbers in terms of Sales. As the festive season is approaching they are targeting a big jump in sales this year.

Mr. Roy knows these is achievable and for this he need something which can ensure him before he take any step, may be some data can help. He is more concerned as increasing Sales has impact on other departments e.g. BigMart need to twist its the marketing budget.

He is aware that BigMart maintains data in its Database system. This data can be very helpful to get the insights and do predictive analysis. Last month, he has hired a Data Scientist to assist him to achieve his target. So based on numbers and analysis he can convince management and the Marketing Manager to make changes in the budget. Now as a Data Analyst it is your job to analyse the data and help Mr Roy to set the Sales Target for the future.
